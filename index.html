    Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement
  </h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Progressive Enhancement</strong> is similiar but in a sense different than <strong>Graceful Degradation</strong>. 
    Progressive Enhancement focuses on content more so than the browser contrary to Graceful Degradation. 
It strives to deliver a consistent level of content and functionality to all users regardless of platform or browser, but of course, the best experience will only be accessible to users on newer browsers as that’s the only platforms it can be available to (kind of like imessages functionality on a new iPhone vs an old. 
Progressive Enhancement is divided into three layers first the core and the simplest <strong>HTML</strong>, then the filling that coats the core which is <strong>CSS</strong>, and finally the shell (outer layer or presentation) which is <strong>Java-Script</strong>.</p>

    Reflection
  </h2>
  <p>
    Starting this Micro website, it was intimidating having to create a website solo for the first time. Although, with all the resources that were at my disposal along with the assignments we’d worked on in the past, it wasn’t too difficult. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I think the things I did well were finding that workflow you mentioned, finding references, gathering images, and coming up with a design for the website. I think I did well finding inspiration from our past work and tweaking it/ making it my own. 
    Although challenging another thing I did decently well at was finding my solutions to some of the issues I had through searching online. Looking for solutions to the various issues I ran into during this project is what took up most of my time, but as you said that’s the best way to learn, to try and to fail. 

  </p>

  <p>
    The one thing I regret not doing or continuing since the beginning of this class is writing down notes. At the start when we first started learning about HTML I had a doc where I wrote down and categorized all the different markings and codings we learned. 
    Then I got lazy and the fact that we already had documents on Github where we were recording all the things that we were learning, but I felt like if I continued to keep everything on one document then things I’d forget later on would be easily accessible. Then with the addition of CSS and the many facets of code we learned about, I think it would have been easier if I continued taking notes. 

  </p>
  
  <p>
    For my feedback, I partnered up with one of my classmates, and we shared each other’s links and reviewed each other's Websites. The adjustments she told me to make were pretty simple for the most part and were things I agreed with to make the website look better. Starting off for the top of each page she suggested I cut the image off a little and center everything. 
    The next suggestion she made was that I enlarge my footer and remove the background on the companies logo (which I did through Adobe Photoshop). The final suggestion she made was that I add a contacts page which was a requirement so of course I added it. 

  </p>

  <p>
    Overall, I feel like this was a successful coding semester, although there’s is still something weighing on me. I don’t think I really enjoy coding. Although there have been moments that I’ve enjoyed, overall I wasn’t able to apply myself 100% because of my lack of enjoyment. With that said, was it due to being consumed with a multitude of other things, was it being so new to the content that I became discouraged, or was it simply the fact that coding isn’t my forteigh? 
    I don’t really have the answer at the moment, but I will do more reflection and career thinking to decide if this is the path I want (UX design).
